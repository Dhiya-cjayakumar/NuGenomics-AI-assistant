
# NuGenomics-AI-Assistant

**NuGenomics-AI-Assistant** is a dual-agent web application built with Flask that:

1. **Customer Support Agent** – Answers NuGenomics FAQs by **live-scraping** the official FAQ page on every request so answers stay up-to-date.
2. **Genetic Wellness Agent** – Handles general genetics & wellness questions via **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** powered by Gemini (Vertex AI).

A single HTML/Tailwind front-end lets users either pick an agent manually or use an **auto-detect classifier** that routes the question to the most relevant agent.

## ✨ Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live FAQ Scraping**      | BeautifulSoup pulls fresh Q\&A pairs from [NuGenomics FAQ](https://www.nugenomics.in/faqs/) at runtime.                            |
| **Semantic FAQ Matching**  | Custom semantic groups + fuzzy matching deliver accurate answers even for paraphrased queries.                                     |
| **Google ADK Integration** | Uses LiteLLM model wrapper and `Runner` + `InMemorySessionService` to orchestrate Gemini calls.                                    |
| **Smart Intent Router**    | Keyword & pattern scorer classifies if the question is support-related or health-science related when **Auto Detect** is selected. |
| **Fully Tested**           | `pytest` suite (5 green tests) covers scraper, matcher, ADK mock, and route integration.                                           |
| **CI-ready**               | External Vertex-AI calls are monkey-patched in tests so the suite runs offline and deterministically.                              |

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-handle/nugenomics_ai_assistant.git
cd nugenomics_ai_assistant
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔐 1. Google Credentials

1. Create a Vertex AI service account with the **Vertex AI User** role.
2. Download the JSON key and store it **outside** your repository.
3. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/your-key.json
# On Windows CMD:
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\path\to\key.json
```

---

## ▶️ 2. Run the App

```bash
python run.py
# Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

You should see:

```text
.....
5 passed in 6.3s
```

✅ ADK network calls are mocked — **no Google billing is incurred** during testing.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

* For production with Gunicorn or Uvicorn, point the WSGI entry to `app:create_app`.
* This app **scrapes live HTML** — if the FAQ site structure changes, update `faq_agent.py` selectors.
* Keep the service account JSON file **outside the repo** and use environment variables for config.
